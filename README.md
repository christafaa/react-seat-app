Seat Manager - view a concert's seat map and assign seats to attendees through the interactive seat map.

Select a concert from the homepage to view that concert's page.<br />
View a concert's attendee list by clicking on the concert's List View link.<br />
View a concert's seat map by clicking on the concert's Seat View link.<br />

To assign seats to an attendee, select any number of available seats (available seats are red) to populate the Selected Seats input of the Purchase Form. Selected seats will turn yellow to indicate they are selected.<br />

Once all requested seats are selected, enter the attendee's name and click Confirm Purchase. If an existing attendee's name is submitted in this form, the existing attendee will be added to the concert's list and a new attendee will not be created. This prevents duplicate records from being created. After clicking Confirm Purchase, the selected seats will change from yellow to grey, indicating that they have been sold.<br />
